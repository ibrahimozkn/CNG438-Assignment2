## Description

This Java application implements a combination of two classic ciphers for encryption and decryption:

Vigenere Cipher: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters according to a specific pattern.
Columnar Transposition Cipher: A transposition cipher that rearranges letters based on a key to create the ciphertext.
## Usage
Interactive Menu:
- [1] Encrypt: Encrypt a plaintext message using the combined ciphers.
- [2] Decrypt: Decrypt a ciphertext message using the combined ciphers.
- [3] Exit: Terminate the program.
Follow Prompts:

Choose the desired option from the menu.
When prompted, enter the plaintext or ciphertext message you want to work with.
Provide a key, which is a sequence of characters used for encryption/decryption.
The program will display the encrypted or decrypted result based on your selection.
